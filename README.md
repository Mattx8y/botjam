## Intro

This is a competition similar to a game jam, you'll be presented with a topic and you'll have to create a discord bot that is similar to the said topic.

## Guidelines

(2) You can only choose 2 - 3 teammates per jam.
  
(3) The bot's idea must be largely similar to the topic.


## Submitting your entry

To submit an entry, you'll fork this repository, and create a new folder in the `entries` folder.

Your folder should consist of the bot's name, and you should create an file named `entry.json`.

```

  "bot_name" : "Your bot's name"
  "authors" : "All author IDs"
  "repository" : "Add your repository's link here!"
}
